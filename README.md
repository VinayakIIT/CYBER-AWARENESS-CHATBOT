# üõ°Ô∏è CyberGuard: Interactive Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

CyberGuard is a dynamic, AI-powered web application designed to teach users about cybersecurity topics in a simple, interactive way. Users can ask questions about phishing, malware, passwords, and more, receiving instant, helpful answers generated by Google's Gemini AI.

This project is built using a modern, decoupled architecture with a static frontend and a separate Python backend API.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Generative AI Bot:** Provides clear, concise answers to cybersecurity questions using the Google Gemini API (specifically the `gemini-1.5-flash` model).
* **Responsive Design:** A sleek, mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.
* **Cyber-Themed UI:** Features animated backgrounds, "glitch" text, and a futuristic aesthetic.
* **Quick-Reply Topics:** Buttons for common topics like "Phishing" and "Passwords" to guide users.
* **Secure API Architecture:** The frontend never exposes the API key. All requests are securely processed through a Python backend gateway.

## üíª Tech Stack

This project is split into two main parts:

* **Frontend (Client-Side):**
    * **HTML5**
    * **Tailwind CSS**
    * **JavaScript (ES6+):** Uses the Fetch API to communicate with the backend.
    * **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (or any static host).

* **Backend (Server-Side):**
    * **Python 3**
    * **Flask:** A micro-framework to create the web server and API endpoints.
    * **Google Gemini API:** The generative AI service that provides the answers.
    * **Gunicorn:** A WSGI server used for production deployment.
    * **Hosting:** Render.com (or any platform-as-a-service).

## üöÄ Setup and Deployment

This project requires **both** the frontend and backend to be deployed and configured to talk to each other.

### 1. Backend Deployment (on Render)

Your backend (`app.py`) must be deployed first so you can get its live URL.

1.  Push your backend code (including `app.py`, `requirements.txt`) to a GitHub repository.
2.  Go to **Render.com** and create a new "Web Service."
3.  Connect this service to your GitHub repository.
4.  Render will auto-detect your `requirements.txt` file and install the libraries:
    ```
    flask
    flask-cors
    google-generativeai
    python-dotenv
    gunicorn
    ```
5.  Set your **Start Command** to: `gunicorn app:app`
6.  Go to the **"Environment"** tab and add your secret API key:
    * **Key:** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
    * **Value:** `AIza...` (Paste your key from Google AI Studio here)
7.  Deploy the service. Render will give you your public URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`).

### 2. Frontend Deployment (on GitHub Pages)

Your frontend (`index.html`) needs to know the address of your backend.

1.  Open your **`index.html`** file.
2.  Find the JavaScript constant at the top of the `<script>` tag:
    ```javascript
    const BACKEND_URL = "...";
    ```
3.  Update this variable with your **live Render URL**, making sure to add the `/ask` endpoint to the end:
    ```javascript
    // This MUST match your backend server address
    const BACKEND_URL = "[https://your-app-name.onrender.com/ask](https://your-app-name.onrender.com/ask)";
    ```
4.  Save this file and push it to your frontend GitHub repository.
5.  In that repository, go to **Settings > Pages** and deploy your `main` branch. Your website will now be live and fully connected.
